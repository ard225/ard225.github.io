Well i finally got through Okamura's palace and to be honest i cant decide which is worse the overly long winded dungion or the boss fight that never seems to end.
I guess i could just say that the boss fight is equal in longwindedness to the rigourous dungion i have had friends tyhat have beaten the dungion in one day and i give them serious props because i could never
attemt such a feet.
