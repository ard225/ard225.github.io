today i went to microcenter and i got a monitor stand a mod mic and an ultrawide monitor. im pretty happy. 
the mod mic ive been told sounds like cabbage. but its more convienient than having a large ball sitting on my desk so im 
happy. my ultrawide monitor is okay... i guess. now i use a special little os maybe you have heard of it i use linux. so 
the ultrawide setup isnt as great as you would think. but it works well enough for what i need. anywho the last thing i got was
the monitor stand. i used it to put my monitor in portrait mode. and now ive got a great setup. yall have a good one.
