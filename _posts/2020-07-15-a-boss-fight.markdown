Shido is a hard boss fight. it took less tries than okumura for sure but still i had to actually bring a shit ton of items for stat neutrilization.
but after about 5 tries i got em. kinda reminds me of the final boss in dragon quest XI that game is awesome and the bosses are hard. 
Paper mario the thousand year door also had some pretty hard bosses but i would say those are only hard because of their respective gimmicks.
