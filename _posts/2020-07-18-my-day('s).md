okay so yesterday was pretty hecktic i beat that boss fight and other obstickles. anywho after the day was about over my friend called and said "were going to friend2's house" and i was like "okay" because my air conditioner
was broken. so i went to my friends house and we decided to go to wafflehouse. i ordered a hamburger with bacon and covered double hashbrowns. now my friends got in to an argument at waffle house. i was feeling
kinda awkward. anyway when we got back to friend2's house i had heartburn and he gave me an anti acicd. it worked well and i fell asleep for 3 hours in his recliner before being woken up and told we were going to
walmart. this was about 7 in the morning i just told him to take me home and i slept until about 1-2pm and woke up. i then went to homedepot to get myself a new air conditioner unit for my room. well at about 5 that 
afternoon after playing some persona i slept until about 11pm and woke up to write this. ANYWAY yall have a good night.
