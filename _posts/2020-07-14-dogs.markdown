Having dogs is a hard thing to have. Not saying i dont love my dogs but when im trying to play games like persona 5 royal they tend to get in the way. 
one of my dogs is fine all she does since she's a dauchund is lays behind my head like a pillow. sometimes thats annoying too. anyway yall have a good night ill see you tommorow.
