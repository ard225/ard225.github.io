so today i had to get some tubs for my wires on my desk and i went to the store with my mom. well we had to wait for several minutes and finally we left walmart. anyway after all that we went back home and had to
go to some other store for some kinda drink she likes. he car broke down. i had to call my stepbrother thankfully we were able to get her car home the inside of her wheel was red hot. my stepdad had just put on
new breaks. my stepbrother said they were probably put on too tight. well im gonna go for now see ya.
