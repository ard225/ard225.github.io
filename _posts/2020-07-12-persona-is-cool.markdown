So I would say I'm half way through with persona 5 royal and i have beaten persona 4 golden.
as of now I can't compare the two games. but if i were to compare dragon quest XI to Persona 4
golden i would say the better game is without a doubt Dragon Quest XI the reason for this
is for the story and gameplay however i would also say you would be hard pressed to compare these 2 games. 
for their respective scores i would give Persona 4 Golden a 7/10 and Dragon Quest XI a 9/10. ill get back 
to you on Persona 5 Royal and maybe Persona 3 FES.
